# EX-2-prompt-engineering-Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test scenerios

Experiment:
Test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. 
     Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

# OUTPUT
Programming Challenge:
"Design an application that monitors CPU and RAM usage in real-time and provides alerts when resource usage exceeds a defined threshold."

Cybersecurity Scenario:
"A university's computer lab is hit by a ransomware attack. Write a response plan detailing how to contain the breach, recover data, and prevent future incidents."

Creative Writing Prompt (Tech Fiction):
"In a future where humans have direct neural interfaces with computers, a bug in the system causes people to experience each other's thoughts like open tabs in a browser."

### PROMPT 1
### 1. Technical (Coding Prompt)
Topic: Data Structures
‚ÄúImplement a priority queue using a min-heap in your preferred programming language. Include methods for insertion, deletion, and peeking at the minimum element.‚Äù

### 2. Discussion/Essay Prompt
Topic: Artificial Intelligence Ethics
‚ÄúDiscuss the ethical implications of using facial recognition technology in public surveillance. Consider privacy, consent, and potential biases in your argument.‚Äù

### 3. Creative Writing Prompt
Topic: Futuristic Computing
‚ÄúIn a world where quantum computers are as common as smartphones, a teenager accidentally writes a script that breaks the global banking encryption system. What happens next?‚Äù
Prompt 1: Custom Linked List Implementation
Task:
Implement a singly linked list from scratch in your preferred language. Include methods for:

Inserting at the head and tail

Deleting a node by value

Searching for a value

Displaying the list

üîπ Prompt 2: LRU Cache
Task:
Design and implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache with the following operations:

get(key): Return the value of the key if present, else -1

put(key, value): Insert or update the value. If the cache reaches capacity, evict the least recently used item.

Use an appropriate combination of hashmap and doubly linked list to achieve O(1) time complexity for both operations.

üîπ Prompt 3: Balanced Brackets Checker Using Stack
Task:
Write a function that takes a string of brackets (()[]{}) and determines if the brackets are balanced.
For example:

"([]{})" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Balanced

"([)]" ‚Üí ‚ùå Not Balanced


### Gemini:
let's dive into some data structure challenges! To get started, could you tell me what specific aspects of data structures you'd like to focus on? For example, are you interested in:

Arrays and Lists? (Manipulation, searching, sorting)
Linked Lists? (Traversal, insertion, deletion, different types like singly, doubly, circular)
Stacks and Queues? (Applications, implementations)
Trees? (Binary trees, BSTs, traversal algorithms, balancing)
Heaps? (Priority queues, heap sort)
Hash Tables? (Collision resolution, performance)
Graphs? (Traversal algorithms like BFS and DFS, shortest paths, graph representations)

### PROMPT 2
### Prompt 1: Bias in AI Algorithms
‚ÄúAI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on. Discuss the consequences of algorithmic bias in fields like hiring, healthcare, and law enforcement. What measures can be taken to mitigate these biases?‚Äù

üîπ Prompt 2: AI and Job Displacement
‚ÄúAs AI continues to automate tasks across various industries, concerns about mass unemployment and job displacement grow. Analyze the ethical responsibility of governments and tech companies in managing this transition.‚Äù

üîπ Prompt 3: Autonomous Weapons and AI in Warfare
‚ÄúShould AI be used to make life-or-death decisions in military contexts? Explore the moral and ethical implications of developing autonomous weapons systems.‚Äù

### Gemini
Ah, a fascinating and crucial topic! Let's delve into the ethical dimensions of Artificial Intelligence. Here's a discussion/essay prompt for you:

Prompt:

"As Artificial Intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives, from healthcare and criminal justice to education and entertainment, a complex web of ethical challenges emerges. Explore the most pressing ethical considerations surrounding the development and deployment of AI. In your discussion, consider issues such as bias and fairness, transparency and explainability (the 'black box' problem), accountability and responsibility, privacy and security, and the potential impact on employment and the future of work. Furthermore, analyze potential approaches and frameworks for mitigating these ethical risks and ensuring the responsible innovation of AI technologies." ¬† 

Feel free to approach this prompt by:

Focusing on one or two specific ethical challenges and exploring them in depth.
Providing a broader overview of several key ethical considerations.
Analyzing existing or proposed ethical guidelines and their effectiveness.
Presenting your own perspective on the most critical ethical priorities in AI development.

### PROMPT 3
Prompt 1: Neural Hacking
‚ÄúIn 2085, computers are implanted directly into the brain. A rogue developer discovers a way to ‚Äòjailbreak‚Äô minds and rewrite people‚Äôs memories‚Äîstarting with their own.‚Äù

üîπ Prompt 2: Post-Quantum World
‚ÄúQuantum computing has rendered all traditional encryption useless overnight. A secret organization scrambles to protect the last unbreakable vault‚Äîguarded not by tech, but by a human with a perfect memory.‚Äù

üîπ Prompt 3: Digital Consciousness
‚ÄúYou wake up in a virtual world and realize your consciousness has been uploaded without your consent. The real you is gone, and now you must find out who did it‚Äîand why.‚Äù

### GEMINI
"The year is 2077. Humans no longer interact with traditional screens or keyboards. Instead, 'Cogni-Weave,' a neural interface technology, seamlessly integrates digital life directly with human consciousness. Imagine a world where thoughts can instantly manifest as complex simulations, where memories can be shared and experienced collectively, and where the lines between the physical and virtual have blurred.

Tell a story about an individual living in this world. Your narrative should explore both the extraordinary possibilities and the unforeseen challenges presented by Cogni-Weave. Consider aspects such as:

How does this technology impact human relationships and communication?
What are the implications for personal identity and privacy?
Are there new forms of art, entertainment, or work that have emerged?
What are the potential societal divides or inequalities that could arise from such advanced technology?
Does the seamless integration of mind and machine come at a cost?
Your story can focus on a specific event, a day in the life of your character, or a broader exploration of this futuristic society. Let your imagination run wild!"
